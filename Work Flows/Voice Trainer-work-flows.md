# Voice Trainer — Folder Workflow

## Purpose
Track voice training consistently (sessions, exercises, recordings, notes, and progress) in a repeatable way that supports review and iteration.

---

## Recommended folder structure (inside `HRT Journey tracker`)
Use (or align to) this structure so logs/recordings are easy to find.

- `Voice Trainer/`
  - `01 - Plans/`
    - routines, weekly plans, goals
  - `02 - Sessions/`
    - session logs (one file per day/session)
  - `03 - Recordings/`
    - raw audio exports, grouped by date
  - `04 - Notes/`
    - technique notes, reflections, reference material
  - `05 - Reviews/`
    - weekly/monthly summaries, metrics, decisions
  - `Templates/`
    - copy-paste templates for sessions and reviews

If your existing folder names differ, keep the same workflow but map the steps below to your actual names.

---

## File naming conventions
Keep names sortable and scannable.

- Dates: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Session logs: `YYYY-MM-DD - Voice Session.md`
- Recording files: `YYYY-MM-DD - <exercise> - take<##>.m4a`
- Weekly review: `YYYY-WW - Weekly Review.md` (or `YYYY-MM-DD` for the week start)

---

## Workflow: end-to-end

### 1) Intake / Setup (one-time, then adjust as needed)
**Goal:** Decide what you’re practicing and how you’ll measure improvement.

1. In `01 - Plans/`, define:
   - Target outcomes (e.g., resonance, pitch stability, clarity, intonation)
   - 3–6 core exercises
   - Session frequency (e.g., 4x/week, 15–25 min)
2. Create (or update) a “current routine” doc:
   - Warmup → Core drills → Transfer practice (speech) → Cooldown
3. Define tracking fields (see Session Template below).

**Output artifacts**
- A single “Current Routine” plan
- A consistent session log format
- A default recording workflow

---

### 2) Before each session (2–3 minutes)
**Goal:** Start clean and comparable across days.

1. Pick your session type:
   - **Technique** (drills) / **Transfer** (conversation/reading) / **Mixed**
2. Decide if you’ll record today (recommended).
3. Create a new session log in `02 - Sessions/` using the template.
4. If recording:
   - Create a dated folder in `03 - Recordings/YYYY-MM-DD/`
   - Verify mic + environment (quiet, consistent distance)

**Output artifacts**
- New session log created
- Recording folder ready (if recording)

---

### 3) Run the session (15–30 minutes)
**Goal:** Execute routine, capture what matters, don’t over-document mid-session.

1. Warmup (breath/posture, gentle onset)
2. Core exercises (2–4 items)
3. Transfer practice
   - Reading a consistent paragraph **or**
   - Spontaneous speech prompt (same prompt each week for comparability)
4. Optional: Record 1–3 takes of the same short material for tracking.

**During session, only note:**
- Any pain/strain (stop if present)
- What felt easier/harder than last time
- Quick scores (1–5) for key metrics

---

### 4) After session (3–8 minutes)
**Goal:** Turn the session into actionable data.

1. Save recordings with the naming convention.
2. In the session log:
   - Summarize what changed (1–3 bullets)
   - Mark best take timestamp/file
   - List 1 next-step adjustment for next session
3. If you noticed discomfort:
   - Record what triggered it and what helped
   - Reduce intensity next time

**Output artifacts**
- Completed session log
- Recordings named + stored
- One clear “next session” action

---

### 5) Weekly review (10–20 minutes, once per week)
**Goal:** Identify trends, decide what to keep/change.

1. Create a weekly review in `05 - Reviews/`.
2. Pull from session logs:
   - Total sessions completed
   - Average scores (or general trend)
   - Common issues (strain, instability, fatigue)
   - One measurable improvement
3. Update `01 - Plans/Current Routine`:
   - Keep: top 1–2 effective drills
   - Change: replace or modify 1 drill max per week
4. Choose next week’s focus (one primary goal).

**Output artifacts**
- Weekly review note
- Updated routine for next week

---

### 6) Monthly checkpoint (optional)
**Goal:** Confirm long-term progress and reset goals.

1. Compare 2–3 recordings from early vs. recent sessions.
2. Update goals and difficulty levels.
3. Archive old routines to keep “Current Routine” clean.

## Templates

### Session Template (copy into each session log)
Use this structure in `02 - Sessions/YYYY-MM-DD - Voice Session.md`:

- **Date/Time:**
- **Session type:** Technique / Transfer / Mixed
- **Duration (min):**
- **Energy/Stress (1–5):**
- **Environment:** (quiet/noisy, mic distance)
- **Warmup:** (what you did)
- **Core drills:** (list + reps/time)
- **Transfer practice:** (reading/prompt)
- **Recordings created:** (filenames + best take)
- **Notes (what changed):**
- **Scores (1–5):**
  - Comfort (no strain):
  - Stability:
  - Resonance placement:
  - Clarity:
- **Next session adjustment (one thing):**

---

### Weekly Review Template
Create in `05 - Reviews/YYYY-WW - Weekly Review.md`:

- **Week of:**
- **Sessions completed / planned:**
- **What improved:**
- **What didn’t / recurring blocker:**
- **Best recording(s):**
- **Focus for next week (one primary):**
- **Routine change (max 1):**

---

## Operating rules (to keep progress consistent)
- Stop if pain/strain appears; log it.
- Change only one variable per week (exercise, target, or intensity).
- Record the same short sample regularly for comparability.
- Prefer short, frequent sessions over rare long sessions.

---

## “Quick use” checklist (daily)
- [ ] Create session log
- [ ] Do routine
- [ ] Save recordings (if any) + name them
- [ ] Write 3 bullets + 1 next step
